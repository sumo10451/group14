## Text-to-Voice (TTS) :: Client and Server Architecture
### Introduction
This Text-to-Voice (TTS) ai project is designed to enable developers to quickly and easily create high-performance, state-of-the-art Text2Speech models for a wide variety of applications. With the help of our Deep Learning models, Speaker Encoder, and Vocoder models, developers can create high-quality synthetic voices for their applications. We provide detailed training logs on the terminal and Tensorboard, as well as fast and efficient model training so that developers can quickly and easily create the best-sounding synthetic voices possible. We also provide tools to curate Text2Speech datasets, utilities to use and test your models, and a modular code base so that developers can easily implement their own ideas. With our TTS ai project, developers can create the best-sounding synthetic voices for their applications. 

### Week 1 : Intro
- Exploring models and understanding them better
- Project build and dependencies installation
- Debugging and exploring different types of flags present 
### Week 2: Initial Stages
- Implementation of client and server architecture over local host
- Grep Access log of apache for the text to convert into voice using a website
- Redirecting the output generated to the website
### Week 3: Localhost Implementation
### Week 4: TLS Configuration
